This is a practice project to maintain my position trades in Indian Equity Markets. 

I have used next.js(API) and react(UI) to implement this project. This is a side project and keep on updating the project bi-weekly to add more cool functionality. 

What's next:
1. User can add/edit their holding directly from the UI.
2. Build cool charts to analyse holdings based on parameters like amount inveted, return on investment and relative return on portfolio.
3. I plan to bring a smart compound interest calculator as well to help forecast future returns for my fellow investors.
